# v_repExtNaoqi
This project is based on a work started by Marco Cognetti, Ph.D. student at "La Sapienza", University of Rome. This fork is currently supported by Giovanni Claudio and Benoit Heintz at the Inria Istitute in Rennes (France).  
This bridge is designed to control a Romeo robot model built in V-REP with Aldebaran softwares (NAOqi SDK, Choregraphe).

This software is tested with:
* naoqi-sdk-1.14.5-linux64
* simulator-sdk-1.14.5-linux64
* V-REP_PRO_EDU_V3_3_0_64_Linux
